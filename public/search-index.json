Permission Errors Problem: FileViewer Pro requests permissions but shows an error. Solution: Ensure you’ve granted all required permissions during the setup process. Double-check your Google Account settings to verify access is enabled for third-party add-ons. If permissions were denied previously, uninstall and reinstall the add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace. 2. Link Issues Problem: The tool cannot open links or displays a “file not accessible” message. Solution: Verify that the link is publicly accessible (i.e., the file is shared with \u0026ldquo;Anyone with the link\u0026rdquo;). Ensure the URL is valid and doesn’t have extra characters or errors. Supported links include those from YouTube and files hosted without CORS restrictions.
