# Privacy Policy for FileViewer Pro

At FileViewer Pro (referred to as “We,” “Us,” “Our,” or “the Add-on”), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Google Workspace add-on for Google Sheets.

## Data Collection and Use

### Minimal Data Collection
We collect only the minimum amount of information necessary to operate our add-on. This includes data explicitly authorized by you via Google OAuth, such as access to files required for the functionality of the add-on.

### Google OAuth Authentication
- We use the Google OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication, which securely grants access to your data without requiring you to share your login credentials.
- The add-on accesses files strictly as required to provide the requested services (e.g., viewing supported files). The data remains within your Google account and is not stored on our servers.

### Email Address Usage
If you authorize access to your email address, it will be used only for essential purposes such as managing your user license, sending receipts, or providing important updates about the add-on.

### No Data Retention for AI/ML
We do not use your data to train, develop, or improve AI or ML models, either personalized or generalized.

## Cookies and Non-Personal Data Collection
We may collect non-personal information such as IP addresses, browser details, and usage statistics through cookies or log files for:
- Analyzing trends
- Diagnosing technical issues
- Improving our add-on's functionality

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, share, or otherwise disclose your information to third parties, except in the following cases:
- As required by law or legal processes
- To protect our rights or investigate fraud
- In the event of a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition

## Security Measures
We take all reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure. While we employ industry-standard security practices, no electronic storage or transmission method is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Integrations
Our add-on integrates with Google Workspace APIs to provide its core functionality. These integrations adhere to Google's security and privacy standards. Any interactions with third-party features are governed by the privacy policies of those providers.

Our add-on uses the Adobe PDF Embed API to provide PDF viewing functionality. The use of this API is governed by Adobe's privacy policy and terms of service. You can review these policies at [Adobe PDF Embed API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-embed-api/).


## Your Rights and Choices

### Account Management
You may uninstall the add-on at any time to deactivate your account and revoke access.

### Requesting Data Deletion
For assistance with account or data deletion, you can contact us. We will respond within five business days.

## Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. If significant updates are made, we will notify users via the email address associated with their account or through an announcement on our website.

## Contact Us
For any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
**Email:** support@fileviewer.pro
**Website:** [fileviewer.pro](https://fileviewer.pro)

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 26th November 2024.
