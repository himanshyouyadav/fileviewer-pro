# Terms of Service for FileViewer Pro

We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

FileViewer Pro does not target its offerings toward, and does not knowingly collect any personal information from, users under 13 years of age.

## Free Service Disclaimer
FileViewer Pro is currently offered as a free service. While we strive to provide a reliable and uninterrupted experience, we do not guarantee availability, uptime, or performance. As a free service, we may limit features or functionality without prior notice.

## Business Transitions
In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

## Our Warranties and Disclaimers
We provide our services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care, and we hope that you will enjoy using them. However, there are certain things we do not promise about our services. We provide the services on an “as is” basis.

We make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties, including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. In no event shall FileViewer Pro be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use our software and services.

## Updates to These Terms
We may update our Terms of Service to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. If significant updates are made, we will notify users via the email address associated with their account or through an announcement on our website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our terms.
