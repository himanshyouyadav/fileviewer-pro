If you encounter any issues while using **FileViewer Pro**, refer to the troubleshooting tips below to resolve them quickly.

## 1. **Permission Errors**
- **Problem:** FileViewer Pro requests permissions but shows an error.
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure you’ve granted all required permissions during the setup process.
  - Double-check your Google Account settings to verify access is enabled for third-party add-ons.
  - If permissions were denied previously, uninstall and reinstall the add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace.

## 2. **Link Issues**
- **Problem:** The tool cannot open links or displays a “file not accessible” message.
- **Solution:**
  - Verify that the link is publicly accessible (i.e., the file is shared with "Anyone with the link").
  - Ensure the URL is valid and doesn’t have extra characters or errors.
  - Supported links include those from **YouTube** and files hosted without CORS restrictions.
